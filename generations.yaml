    description: "The original Ford Everest was a mid-size SUV based on the Mazda-derived Ford Ranger pickup truck platform. Developed primarily for Asian markets, it featured traditional body-on-frame construction with rugged styling and genuine off-road capability. Offering three rows of seating for up to seven passengers, it combined utility with family-friendly features. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included 2.5L and 3.0L diesel engines and a 2.6L petrol engine, paired with manual or automatic transmissions and part-time four-wheel drive. The interior was basic but functional, prioritizing durability over luxury. This generation established the Everest as a popular option in emerging markets where its combination of ruggedness, practicality, and affordability was highly valued."

  - name: "Second Generation"

    end_year: 2015
    description: "The second-generation Everest maintained its Ranger pickup underpinnings but with significant refinements to ride quality and interior comfort. The exterior featured more modern styling while preserving the rugged SUV character. Engine options evolved to include more efficient and powerful diesel units, including a 2.5L and 3.0L Duratorq TDCi, with improved automatic transmission options. The interior saw notable improvements in design, material quality, and features, including available leather seating, improved climate control, and enhanced entertainment systems. Safety features were expanded to include electronic stability control and multiple airbags on higher trims. This generation continued the Everest's focus on markets in Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Central America, where it competed against vehicles like the Toyota Fortuner and Mitsubishi Pajero Sport in the popular truck-based SUV segment."

  - name: "Third Generation"
    start_year: 2015
    end_year: 2022
    description: "The third-generation Everest represented a significant advancement while maintaining its Ranger-based underpinnings. The exterior featured more sophisticated styling with a prominent trapezoidal grille and complex surface detailing. Engineered for global markets (though still not sold in North America), it offered significantly improved refinement while maintaining serious off-road capability. Powertrain options centered around Ford's Duratorq diesel engines, including a 2.2L four-cylinder and a 3.2L five-cylinder, with some markets later receiving the 2.0L EcoBlue bi-turbo diesel. The interior marked a major step forward with a contemporary design, improved materials, and advanced technology including SYNC infotainment systems. Safety features expanded to include adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping aid, and automatic emergency braking on higher trims. This generation successfully broadened the Everest's appeal beyond purely utilitarian use, attracting customers seeking a combination of off-road capability, practicality, and increasingly car-like refinement."

    description: "The current Everest is based on the latest T6.2 platform shared with the newest Ranger. The exterior features a bold, upright design with C-clamp headlights and a strong shoulder line. Powertrain options vary by market but typically include a 2.0L EcoBlue single and bi-turbo diesel options, plus a 3.0L V6 turbo diesel in higher-spec models. Some markets also offer a 2.3L EcoBoost petrol engine. The interior represents the most significant advancement in the model's history, featuring a digital instrument cluster and portrait-oriented touchscreen (up to 12 inches) running SYNC 4A. Available features include matrix LED headlights, a 360-degree camera system, and Ford's advanced driver assistance systems. Off-road capability remains a priority with available full-time four-wheel drive, an electronic locking rear differential, and specific off-road drive modes. This generation aims to bridge the gap between work-oriented SUVs and premium offerings, with higher trim levels featuring luxury appointments including leather upholstery, ambient lighting, and premium audio systems."
