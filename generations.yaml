    description: "Ford unveiled the first-generation Everest in March 2003 at the Bangkok International Motor Show. The original Ford Everest was a mid-size SUV based on the Mazda-derived Ford Ranger pickup truck platform, developed primarily for Asian markets. It featured traditional body-on-frame construction with rugged styling and genuine off-road capability. Offering three rows of seating for up to seven passengers, it combined utility with family-friendly features. Powertrain options included a 2.6L petrol engine (Mazda G6E I4) and diesel options: 2.5L WL Duratorq I4, 2.5L WL-T Duratorq turbo I4, and 3.0L VS Duratorq turbo I4, paired with 5-speed manual, 4-speed, or 5-speed automatic transmissions and part-time four-wheel drive. The interior was basic but functional, prioritizing durability over luxury."

The changes included an updated front fascia, new transmission, and improved engine. The redesign featured the new 5-speed automatic transmission with BorgWarner transfer case, and Active-Shift-on-the-Fly function (4x4 only).

While the changes were less prominent than the previous facelift, the Everest now featured a rounder fascia than its predecessor, similar to the facelifted Ranger. The changes were achieved by replacing the front fender assembly, front hood, front headlights, front grille, and front bumper, along with larger 18-inch polished alloy wheels, a redesigned tailgate, and new tail lamps. The platform remained unchanged with its U268 project code."
